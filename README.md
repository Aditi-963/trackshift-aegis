Aegis: AI Race Strategist. Prevent race-losing calls! We simulate rivals with human flaws (panic, pressure) &amp; real chaos to find the one strategy that survives unpredictable drivers, not just physics.
# Aegis: The AI Race Strategist

**Elevator Pitch:**
> Aegis: The AI Race Strategist. While other sims model physics, we model *pressure*. Our 'human-flaw' AI rivals panic, get greedy & crack. Aegis finds the winning strategy when humans (not just cars) are unpredictable.

**Note on Code:** Due to time constraints during the hackathon, the code in this repository consists primarily of placeholder files representing the planned architecture and key components. The core focus was on developing the concept, strategy, and the innovative 'Human-Flaw' AI simulation approach described below.

## Inspiration
We've all watched a race. We've all seen a driver make *one bad decision*—pitting one lap too late in the rain—that costs them the entire championship. It's heartbreaking. What if that team could have seen the future? That's why we built Aegis.

---
## What it does
Aegis is not a physics simulator; it's a **strategy simulator**. We model AI agents with 'human flaws' (like panic or aggression) and use a 'Chaos Engine' to trigger unpredictable events (like rain). Our 'Mission Control' dashboard shows the race and live 'Win Probabilities' as agents react differently.

---
## Planned Architecture
* **Backend:** Python/FastAPI server to manage simulation state.
* **Frontend:** React application to visualize the data via API calls.
* **Visualization:** D3.js / Chart.js for rendering the track, agents, and charts.

## Challenges we ran into
Making the AI feel 'human' with simple rules, even conceptually, was a key challenge within the limited time, and also ofcourse difficulty setting up the development environment quickly.

---
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Conceptualizing the 'Human-Flaw' AI and the 'Live Heartrate' idea to simulate pressure are accomplishments we're proud of, as they target the psychological aspect of racing, differentiating our approach.

---
## What we learned
We learned that simulating *behavior* and *pressure* might be more insightful for strategy than just physics. Storytelling and a polished concept (even with placeholder code) are crucial for conveying a complex idea quickly. A clear plan matters.

## What's next for Aegis
Integrate live weather APIs, train the 'Persona AI' on real driver data, and partner with a race team to test Aegis in finding real-world winning strategies.
